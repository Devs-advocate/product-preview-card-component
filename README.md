## My process

This challenge is part of the learning path for responsive design. I did some of the recommended research on the topic before attempting the challenge.
I also used the mobile-first approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS is tough and finnicky, and making good decisions about how to achieve an outcome is important, because every aspect after is affected by it. Of note, I learned how to use different images for different screen resolutions in HTML, using the srcset attribute.

### Continued development

The learning doesn't end, and there's still much to continually research. The use of images needs further work.
